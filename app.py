# --- Running Instructions (as comments) ---
# These comments guide the user on how to set up and run the Streamlit application.
# 1. Make sure you have all libraries installed: pip install streamlit langchain langchain_google_genai python-dotenv
# 2. Ensure your .env file with GOOGLE_API_KEY is in the `eli5_text_simplifier` directory.
# 3. Open your terminal in the `eli5_text_simplifier` directory.
# 4. Run: streamlit run app.py
